Getting started
***************

The most common and fun things to do in SDIS revolve around project approval
and taking the "ow" out of the "how" of annual reporting.

Gone are the days of emailing MS Word documents - the future is here, and it's
all in your browser. SDIS will tell you what to do (your Tasks), offer short cuts
to your Projects, and allow you to browse other Projects and Reports.
If there are urgent or new Tasks, SDIS will notify you via email.

Find a Project
==============
On the ``"Browse all Projects" page <https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au/projects/project/>`_
you can filter and search for projects.
Under "actions", a selected list of projects can also be exported to CSV or MS Excel spreadsheets.


Create a new Science Project
============================
* On the `SDIS home page <https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au>`_ click Create New Project
* In the Project Type dropdown box select Science Project
* Enter a project title and divisional program (and as many other fields as you can fill in), then click Save Changes
* In the Overview tab, enter team members. External team members must first be registered with SDIS (see below - Register external colleague). Once registered, click Add team member and select them as you would any staff member. Click Edit Project Details to provide additional information such as location, then click Save Changes.
* In the Concept Plan tab, enter the details of your concept plan, then click Save Changes.
* Submit the concept plan for review (Submit for review button) by your Program Leader.

Core Functions look the same as Science Projects, however they are maintained by SDIS admins.

Create a new External Partnership
=================================
* On the SDIS home page (https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au) click Create New Project
* In the Project Type dropdown box select Collaboration Project
* Enter a project title and divisional program, then click Save Changes
* In the Overview tab, enter team members. External collaborators must first be registered with SDIS (see below - Register external colleague). Once registered, click Add team member and select them as you would any staff member.

Create a new Student Project
============================

* In the Project Type dropdown box select Student Project
* Enter a project title and divisional program, then click Save Changes
* In the Overview tab, enter team members. If student is external you must first register them with SDIS (see below - Register external colleague). Once registered, click Add team member and select them as you would any staff member.

Add a DPaW employee as team member
======================================
Before SDIS can add DPaW employees to teams, they have to login once in person,
so that SDIS adds them to its internal user database.

A user that has never logged in cannot be added to teams or into project roles.

Register an external colleague
==============================
* Click on the project Overview tab or open Menu > Staff
* Click Register external colleague
* Provide a username (use firstname_surname) and password (can be same as username)
  and click Save Changes (first screen). Ignore the next screen.
* Enter as many user details as you can and click Save Changes.

Now the new user can be added to project teams or project roles.
