The Science Directorate Information System (SDIS) is the project documentation,
approval and reporting platform for DPaW's Science and Conservation Division.

This documentation is targeted at SDIS users, answering frequently asked questions,
guiding through most common tasks, and finally going through all use cases in
full detail.

Maintainers will want to consult the internal
`DPaW SDIS Wiki <https://confluence.dpaw.wa.gov.au/display/SDIS/Maintainer+documentation>`_
