The Science Directorate Information System (SDIS) is the project documentation,
approval and reporting platform for DPaW's Science and Conservation Division.

SDIS users will find answers to their `Frequently Asked Questions`_,
`Getting started`_ with the most common tasks. This should enable any user to
fulfill their Tasks as required.

Interested readers may learn in full detail about the `User Roles`_ (governing who
can see and do what and when), and how to play the Monopoly game of advancing
projects through the `Project Life Cycles`_ by solving the side quests of
`Document Life Cycles`_.
In tech speak, those are the Functional Requirements of SDIS,
and we should have a test case covering each of them. The "Test Coverage" badge
above shows how much we've got covered; the "Test Status" badge shows whether
the existing tests pass (and SDIS behaves as we expect).

Technically minded readers will greatly enjoy the `Maintainer Documentation`_,
be enthralled by the `Developer Documentation`_, and relish in the depths of the
`Technical Documentation`_.
