The Science Directorate Information System (SDIS) is the project documentation,
approval and reporting platform for DPaW's Science and Conservation Division.

SDIS users will find answers to their :doc:`faq`,
and instructions on :doc:`quickstart` with the most common tasks.
This should enable any user to fulfill their tasks on SDIS as required.

Interested readers may learn in full detail about the :doc:`user_docs`
(governing who can see and do what and when), and how to play the Monopoly game of advancing
projects through their life cycles by solving the side quests of document approvals.
In tech speak, those are the Functional Requirements of SDIS,
and we should have a test case covering each of them. The "Test Coverage" badge
above shows how much we've got covered; the "Test Status" badge shows whether
the existing tests pass (and SDIS behaves as we expect).

Technically minded readers will greatly enjoy the :doc:`maintainer_docs` and the :doc:`developer_docs`.
