Where are my projects?
======================

The `SDIS home page <https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au/>`_ will display projects
you supervise or participate in under "My Projects".

Note:

* "My Tasks", "My Projects", and "My Collaborations" expand/collapse when clicked on.
* A black star indicates that you lead the project as "project owner".
* A hollow star indicates that you are part of the project team.


Is there anything SDIS wants me to do?
======================================

If there are any documents awaiting your input, and possibly any approval actions,
they will be shown on the `SDIS home page <https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au/>`_ under
"My Tasks". Click each link, update the content as appropriate, save the changes,
and if appropriate, execute any approval steps shown under "Actions".

Note: Save your changes before leaving the page or executing any actions.


Why can't I submit my project's related documents for review, or request project closure?
=========================================================================================
Only project team members can execute these life cycle steps. If you can't, but
feel you should be able to, an existing project team member has to add you to the
team.
