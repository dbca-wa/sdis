Frequently Asked Questions
**************************

Many questions will be covered by the instructions in :doc:`quickstart`.

Where are my projects?
======================

The `SDIS home page <https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au/>`_ will display projects
you supervise or participate in under "My Projects".

Note:

* "My Tasks", "My Projects", and "My Collaborations" expand/collapse when clicked on.
* A black star indicates that you lead the project as "project owner".
* A hollow star indicates that you are part of the project team.

Where can I search for other projects?
======================================
The "Browse all Projects" allows you to filter projects by any of the columns.
Click on any of the column headings to sort or filter the list.
You can type to filter the dropdown menus!

"Browse all Projects" is also available in the top menu bar under "Projects".

Is there anything SDIS wants me to do?
======================================

If there are any documents awaiting your input, and possibly any approval actions,
they will be shown on the `SDIS home page <https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au/>`_ under
"My Tasks". Click each link, update the content as appropriate, save the changes,
and if appropriate, execute any approval steps shown under "Actions".

Note: Save your changes to documents before leaving the page or executing any actions.

Why can't I submit my project's related documents for review, or request project closure?
=========================================================================================
Only project team members can execute these life cycle steps. If you can't, but
feel you should be able to, an existing project team member has to add you to the
team.


Why can't I update my project or edit documents?
================================================
You need to be on the project team to have write permission to the project or
its documents.
Furthermore, only "new" documents are editable - that's when the project
team is meant to fill in the document. Once a document is submitted for review to
the Program Leader ("reviewers"), only they can edit it. Once a document is
submitted to the Directorate ("approvers"), again only they can edit it.

If you wish to update a document sitting with your Program Leader "in review",
you can "recall" it from review, edit it, and resubmit it for review.

Can I download documents?
=========================
You sure can! The "View PDF" link above each document will create a beautifully
laid out PDF with a cover page indicating its approval status and project details.
The PDFs have links in the page headers back to their online counterparts in SDIS.


What will happen when a new ARAR is kicked off?
===============================================
A new Annual Research Actitivy Report (ARAR) is created every year. It will request
updates from all Science Projects, Core Functions, and Student Projects.
It will include project level details from all existing External Collaborations.

* You will get one broadcast email when the ARAR process starts.
* SDIS will not email you separately for progress reports
* SDIS will show any progress reports requiring your input under "My Tasks"

Before the ARAR gets kicked off, make sure to get your things in SDIS up to date:

* Create new projects, start their approval process
* Close old projects (some will have a closure process incolving document approval)
* Update team lists on projects.

This will prevent SDIS from unknowingly requesting updates from long dead projects
(which create extra effort to get rid off again).

Can I provide ARAR updates before the new cycle begins?
=======================================================
No, not really - only kicking off a new ARAR cycle will create the documents
you need to update. They simply don't exist earlier.
If you need to provide early updates (e.g. because of field work), use the latest
progress reports as starting point (copy out the text), and email the new version
to Florian.
