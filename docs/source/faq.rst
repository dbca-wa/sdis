Frequently Asked Questions
**************************

Many questions will be covered by the instructions in :doc:`quickstart`.

Where are my projects?
======================

The `SDIS home page <https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au/>`_ will display projects
you supervise or participate in under "My Projects".

Note:

* "My Tasks", "My Projects", and "My Collaborations" expand/collapse when clicked on.
* A black star indicates that you lead the project as "project owner".
* A hollow star indicates that you are part of the project team.


Is there anything SDIS wants me to do?
======================================

If there are any documents awaiting your input, and possibly any approval actions,
they will be shown on the `SDIS home page <https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au/>`_ under
"My Tasks". Click each link, update the content as appropriate, save the changes,
and if appropriate, execute any approval steps shown under "Actions".

Note: Save your changes before leaving the page or executing any actions.


Why can't I submit my project's related documents for review, or request project closure?
=========================================================================================
Only project team members can execute these life cycle steps. If you can't, but
feel you should be able to, an existing project team member has to add you to the
team.


Why can't I update my project or edit documents?
================================================
You need to be on the project team to have write permission to the project or
its documents.
Furthermore, only "new" documents are editable - that's when the project
team is meant to fill in the document. Once a document is submitted for review to
the Program Leader ("reviewers"), only they can edit it. Once a document is
submitted to the Directorate ("approvers"), again only they can edit it.

If you wish to update a document sitting with your Program Leader "in review",
you can "recall" it from review, edit it, and resubmit it for review.
