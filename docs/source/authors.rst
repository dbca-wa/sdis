Project owners and teams
************************

This chapter guides project owners and their teams through their tasks.

Project owners are those who register a Project in SDIS to get departmental approval.
They have to author documents and submit them for approval.

Complete your Profile
=====================
* Follow the link "My SDIS Profile" in the main menu underneath your name.
* Update your Profile and save.

Create a Project
==============================
* Choose the Project type - you cannot change the type later on.
* Fill out Project details. See the FAQ for guidance on thumbnail images, and read the helptext of the form fields.
* Next, add colleagues to the Team list, and fill out the first Document, the Concept Plan.

Add DBCA colleagues to a Project Team
=====================================
* At the Project's detail page, click on the "Add team member" button to select any DBCA colleague.
* The DBCA colleague must have visited SDIS prior to that in order to be known to SDIS. 
  They should also update their profile so SDIS gets their name and title right in Team lists.
* Only Project Team members can update Documents.
* Project Team members can add others to the Team.

Add an external colleague to a Project Team
===========================================
* At the Project's detail page, click on the "Register an external colleague" button to create a new User profile for them.
* Once you have created and saved the new SDIS User profile, you can add them to the Project Team via "Add team member".
* Student Projects and External Partnerships often have external colleagues.

Document visibility
===================
* Currently, only BCS staff are meant to see Project Documents. 
* Members of other Divisions will see no reference to Documents and are not required to fill in any Documents. Less work!
* If you however think you should see more or less Documents than you currently do, please get in touch with the administrators.

Complete and submit a Document
==============================
This section applies generally to any SDIS Document.

* Click on any field to enable a rich text editor.
* Follow the guidance in the helptext of the form fields.
* Finish editing the document by clicking on the "Save" button at the bottom.
* You can view the edit history through the "History" link at the top, and restore older versions if needed.
* Documents are editable only to those involved (Project team members as per the Project overview, reviewers, approvers), 
  and only when it is their turn to provide input.
* If a Document is read-only, you should not have any reason to update it. If that seems wrong, contact the admins.

Register your Data
==============================
* Once the Concept Plan is approved, the Project is near guaranteed to be approved. Now it is time to set up data management.
* Create an account on the `Data Catalogue <https://data.dbca.wa.gov.au/>`_ (with its own password - NOT your DBCA password).
* Contact the Data Catalogue admin for write access to your Program(s). 
  They will add you to as "members" of the Data Catalogue "Organization" corresponding to your DBCA Program (or equivalent).
* Create initial metadata entries for all expected datasets on the Data Catalogue.
* Label them with your project code, e.g. ``SP-2022-001``.

Provide a Progress Report
==============================
* When an annual report requires an update from your Project(s), you will receive a broadcast email ahead of time, 
  and find any ProgressReport Documents in your TODO list.


Close a Project
==============================
* The months before annual reporting are a good time to initiate project closure for any completed or otherwise finished projects.
* You can close a Project by clicking on the "Request Closure" button on the Project's detail page. This generates a Project Closure Document.
* Fill out and submit the Project Closure Document for review.
* There are several flavours of Project Closure determining what comes next:
  * The Project was completed successfully, and all progress was reported in the last annual report. There is no need for a final Progress Report.
  * Same, but some progress was made after the last annual report. A final Progress Report is required.
  * The Project is suspended. No Progress Report will be required. The Project might be resumed later.
  * The Project is terminated. No Progress Report will be required.
* Update the Project's datasets on the Data Catalogue. 
  This is the last time someone with intimate knowledge of the data is around to do so. 
  This preserves the Project's data outputs, and your name will live on in the metadata.

Find Help
==============================
* Read this documentation carefully.
* Consult the :doc:`faq`.
* Ask the admins.
* If you think you've encountered a bug, feel free to open an `issue here <https://github.com/dbca-wa/sdis/issues>`_.
