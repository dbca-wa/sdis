Project owners and teams
************************

This chapter guides project owners and their teams through their tasks.

Project owners are those who register a Project in SDIS to get departmental approval.
They have to author documents and submit them for approval.

Create a Project
==============================
* Choose the Project type - you cannot change the type later on.
* Fill out Project details. See the FAQ for guidance on thumbnail images, and read the helptext of the form fields.
* Next, fill out the first Document, the Concept Plan.

Complete and submit a Document
==============================

Register your Data
==============================
* Once the Concept Plan is approved, the Project is near guaranteed to be approved. Now it is time to set up data management.
* Create an account on the `Data Catalogue <https://data.dbca.wa.gov.au/>`_ (with its own password - NOT your DBCA password).
* Contact the Data Catalogue admin for write access to your Program(s). 
  They will add you to as "members" of the Data Catalogue "Organization" corresponding to your DBCA Program (or equivalent).
* Create initial metadata entries for all expected datasets on the Data Catalogue.
* Label them with your project code, e.g. ``SP-2022-001``.
