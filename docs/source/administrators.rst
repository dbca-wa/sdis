Administrators
**************************************************

This chapter guides administrators (admins) through their tasks.

SDIS admins have backstage access to all data and have permissions to perform any action.

SDIS maintainers in contrast have access to the database backend and can easily and safely modify data in bulk.

The role of admin, maintainer, and developer is currently shared.

Download a data snapshot
========================

Go to the Project list and click "Download Projects" to get a full list of Projects with their details.
**Do not** update this spreadsheet - do update projects directly in SDIS instead.

Close annual reporting cycle
============================
* Close any progress reports which are "in approval" through Menu > Backstage > Batch-approve all Progress Reports.
* This can be done as soon as the annual report content is print ready.
* Approving a Progress Report reverts its Project from "update requested" to its normal "approved and active" state.

Prepare SDIS for a new annual reporting cycle
=============================================
Instruct the Directorate to solicit the following actions from SDIS Project Teams through an email broadcast:

* Initiate Project Closure for any complete, suspended, or terminated Project (SP or CF). 
  These projct types require a formal approval process and might solicit a last Progress Report.
* Close any completed Student Project or External Partnership. These project types close immediately without any approval process.
* Register and seek approval for any new Project, especially those which have progressed significantly since the last annual report.
* Update all External Partnerships. Their Project details will be used in the annual report.
* Remember that only members of a Project Team have permission to update Project Documents, 
  and they can add other SDIS Users to the Team to give colleagues write permissions.

Allow sufficient time for Project teams to register their new Projects and author Project Closure documents, 
and SCMT to discuss and approve Project closures.

Create a new annual reporting cycle
===================================
Precondition:

* All Projects, their documentation, and their approval are up to date. 
* Project closures are initiated and approved. Projects with "closure pending final update" will participate in the upcoming annual report.

Action:

* `Create a new BCS Annual Report <https://sdis.dbca.wa.gov.au/pythia/ararreport/add/>`_.
* Select all participating Divisions. This is likely only BCS.
* Enter the reporting year.
* Chapter images and introductions can be updated later on.
* Open/close dates are not acted upon, they are optional.

On creation of a new annual report, and only when it is created for the first time, 
all relevant projects will enter the life cycle state "update requested" and spawn a new Progress Report (SP and CF)
or StudentReport (STP). This populates the "My Tasks" portfolio of each User, but will not send email notifications.

Post action:

* Broadcast to all involved staff that annual reporting season is now open.
* Members of External Partnerships do now have to provide a Progress Report, but need to update Project details or close them where appropriate.
