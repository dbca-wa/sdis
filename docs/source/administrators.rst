Administrators

This chapter guides administrators (admins) through their tasks.

SDIS admins have backstage access to all data and have permissions to perform any action.

SDIS maintainers in contrast have access to the database backend and can easily and safely modify data in bulk.

The role of admin, maintainer, and developer is currently shared.
