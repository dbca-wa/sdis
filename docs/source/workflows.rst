Getting started
***************

The most common and fun things to do in SDIS revolve around project approval
and taking the "ow" out of the "how" of annual reporting.

Gone are the days of emailing MS Word documents - the future is here, and it's
all in your browser. SDIS will tell you what to do (your Tasks), offer short cuts
to your Projects, and allow you to browse other Projects and Reports.
If there are urgent or new Tasks, SDIS will notify you via email.

Find a Project
==============
On the ``"Browse all Projects" page <https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au/projects/project/>`_
you can filter and search for projects.
Under "actions", a selected list of projects can also be exported to CSV or MS Excel spreadsheets.


Create a new Science Project
============================
* On the `SDIS home page <https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au>`_ click Create New Project
* In the Project Type dropdown box select Science Project
* Enter a project title and divisional program (and as many other fields as you can fill in), then click Save Changes
* In the Overview tab, enter team members. External team members must first be registered with SDIS (see below - Register external colleague). Once registered, click Add team member and select them as you would any staff member. Click Edit Project Details to provide additional information such as location, then click Save Changes.
* In the Concept Plan tab, enter the details of your concept plan, then click Save Changes.
* Submit the concept plan for review (Submit for review button) by your Program Leader.

Core Functions look the same as Science Projects, however they are maintained by SDIS admins.

Create a new External Partnership
=================================
* On the SDIS home page (https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au) click Create New Project
* In the Project Type dropdown box select Collaboration Project
* Enter a project title and divisional program, then click Save Changes
* In the Overview tab, enter team members. External collaborators must first be registered with SDIS (see below - Register external colleague). Once registered, click Add team member and select them as you would any staff member.
* Click Edit project details, then under Collaboration details enter the collaboration name and budget.

Create a new Student Project
============================
* On the SDIS home page (https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au) click Create New Project
* In the Project Type dropdown box select Student Project
* Enter a project title and divisional program, then click Save Changes
* In the Overview tab, enter team members. If student is external you must first register them with SDIS (see below - Register external colleague). Once registered, click Add team member and select them as you would any staff member.
* Click Edit project details, then under Student project details enter the study level and academic organisation.

Add a DPaW employee as team member
======================================
Before SDIS can add DPaW employees to teams, they have to login once in person,
so that SDIS adds them to its internal user database.

A user that has never logged in cannot be added to teams or into project roles.

Register an external colleague
==============================
* Click on the project Overview tab or open Menu > Staff
* Click Register external colleague
* Provide a username (use firstname_surname) and password (can be same as username)
  and click Save Changes (first screen). Ignore the next screen.
* Enter as many user details as you can and click Save Changes.

Now the new user can be added to project teams or project roles.


**********
User Roles
**********

SDIS features a role-based permission system, based on three roles:

Project teams
=============
Team members and holders of project roles have the "submit" permission
for their respective project and its related documents. This allows them to
execute approval actions, e.g. submitting a document for review, or requesting
project closure.

Project roles are Project Owner, Data Custodian and Site Custodian.
All three default to the creator of a new Project, but can be updated at any time.
The Project Owner is added as "Supervising Scientist" to the project team when
a project is created. The Project Owner, and any other team members, can add/edit
Team membership.

While every logged in SDIS user can update any document (these updates are logged),
only team members of a project can execute any life cycle steps, such as
submitting related documents for review, or requesting closure.


Program Leaders
===============
Members of SCMT (all Program Leaders) have the permission "review".
This allows them to review documents (Concept Plans, Project Plans,
Progress Reports, Closure Forms, Student Reports), update them if appropriate,
and submit further up the approval chain, or request updates from the authors.

Directorate
===========
Representatives of the SCD Directorate (e.g. Director's EA) have the
authority to approve documents, or manage annual reports such as the ARAR.
Approval of documents will reflect the decisions of the SCMT and Directorate,
and will cause projects to proceed in their life cycle.

Project Life Cycles
*******************

This section goes into the full detail about the supported Project types and their life cycles.
In a nutshell, Project approval in SDIS is like playing a board game.
Newly created projects spawn documents, which have to be filled in and sent through their own
approval work flow. Approval of documents advances projects to new life cycle stages.


Science Projects and Core Functions
===================================

   :alt: Science Project Life Cycle

Science Projects have a two-stage approval process, annual reporting requirements,
and a two-stage closure process.

Science Project Approval
------------------------
* Create new Science Project
* Update and submit ConceptPlan
* Update and submit ProjectPlan


Science Project Annual Reporting
--------------------------------
* Get email broadcast about Annual Report
* Find all progress reports in "My Tasks", update and submit them all
* If an update is rejected, it will turn up in "My Tasks" again


Science Project Closure
-----------------------
* Request closure
* Update and submit Closure Form
* Wait for last annual report, provide final Progress Report


External Partnerships
=====================
.. image:: img/tx_CollaborationProject.png
   :alt: External Partnership Life Cycle

Partnerships have on approval or closure process, and require no separate annual updates.
Simply registering, updating project details every now and then,
and closing them as required will be enough.

Student Projects
================
.. image:: img/tx_StudentProject.png
   :alt: Student Project Life Cycle

Student Projects have no approval workflow or closure process, but require
simple annual progress reports.

Progress reports requiring your input will turn up in "My Tasks" as well.


********************
Document Life Cycles
********************
.. image:: img/tx_Document.png
   :alt: Document Life Cycle

All documents share the same approval work flow:

* Submitters update the content, then submit for review.
* Reviewers reject or submit for approval.
* Approvers reject (to reviewers or submitters) or approve the document.
* Approvers can reset the document to "new" and fast-track it through its approval stages.

Document approval will often advance their project to a new stage.
