This chapter guides reviewers through their tasks.

SDIS Reviewers are the heads of SDIS Programs: Program Leaders, Regional Leaders, Branch Managers.
In SDIS terminology, we call them all "reviewers", and call their organsational units "SDIS Programs".

They have to review and endorse Documents related to Projects of their SDIS Program.

Review a Document
==================
Every Document will be submitted to the reviewer in the first instance.
The reviewer is encouraged to

* Edit any text where appropriate - e.g. small typos or formatting.
  
  * Click into any text block to toggle the editor. 
  * Edit any number of text blocks. 
  * After editing, save the document with the green save button at the bottom.
  * Saving a Document creates a new revision in the Document history (top right). Changes are reversible. 

Take actions on the Document:
  
  * Avaliable actions are offered in the sidebar at the top right under "Actions".
  * Request a revision from the authors for bigger changes. 
    We expect that communcation regarding these changes can happen through fastest and preferred channels 
    outside of SDIS, such as MS Teams, email, or a simple chat.
  * Once happy with the Document, the reviewer must submit the Document for approval.
  * If a button was pressed unintentionally, the reviewer can reverse the action with an opposite action, e.g. 
    a Document can be withdrawn from approval to be edited some more.
  * Every action will create a new TODO item for involved staff. They will see this when they next visit SDIS in their TODO list.
  * Every action will offer to notify involved staff via email.

Review a Project Plan
=====================
Before a Project Plan can be submitted for approval, the reviewer must enter Endorsements of the Biometrician, Data Manager, Herbarium Curator, and Animal Ethics Committee as required.

Endorsements are parallel approval processes of unlreated parties which may happen in any order.
Therefore, they are not modelled as approval actions, but as special features of the Project Plan.

Find required Endorsements
--------------------------
The sidebar lists the status of all Endorsements - not required, required, granted, or denied.

Enter Endorsements
------------------
* The Program Leader can enter Endorsements by editing the respective field in the Project Plan Document. 
* Some require to scroll down the page. Endorsements can be selected from the respective drop-down menu.
* On saving the Document, the Endorsement status in the sidebar will update.
* Once all required Endorsements are granted, the Action "submit for approval" will be unlocked and visible.

Manage SDIS emails
===================
SDIS prefixes the subject of all emails sent from the system with ``[SDIS]``. 
This allows to create an inbox rule to e.g. move all SDIS emails into an inbox subfolder, e.g. named "SDIS".
 
Export a Document to PDF
=========================
Every Document can be exported to PDF through the link at the page top right. PDFs can be "generated" (freshly recreated) and "downloaded" (last saved PDF version). PDFs contain a nicely formatted header indicating the approval status and hyperlinks to SDIS.
