# Handsontable [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/warpech/jquery-handsontable.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/warpech/jquery-handsontable)

Handsontable is a minimalistic approach to Excel-like table editor in HTML & jQuery. Requires jQuery 1.9+ or 2.0+ (may work with 1.7+ too, but there are known issues with [IE10](https://github.com/warpech/jquery-handsontable/issues/410)).

Runs in IE 8-11, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera.

See the demos at http://handsontable.com/ or fork the example on [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/warpech/hU6Kz/).

## Usage

First, include all the dependencies. All the files that you need (apart from jQuery) are in the `dist\` directory:

```html
<script src="../lib/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="dist/jquery.handsontable.full.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="dist/jquery.handsontable.full.css">
```

Then, run `handsontable()` constructor on an empty div. After that, load some data if you wish:

```html
<div id="dataTable"></div>
<script>
  var data = [
    ["", "Kia", "Nissan", "Toyota", "Honda"],
    ["2008", 10, 11, 12, 13],
    ["2009", 20, 11, 14, 13],
    ["2010", 30, 15, 12, 13]
  ];
  $("#dataTable").handsontable({
    data: data,
    startRows: 6,
    startCols: 8
  });
</script>
```
