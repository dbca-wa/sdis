Science Project Management System
======================================
Science Project Management System (SPMS) is a web portal to register, approve, and report on Science Projects across DBCA.
Some Divisions experience a streamlined version with simplified functionality.

Its main module "pythia" is named after the priestess at the heart of the
Greek oracle of Delphi, whose comments and approvals were used as an early
project planning tool.

Refer to the documentation for advice on use, development, and deployment.
